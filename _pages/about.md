I am a first year economics PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley. Previously, I was a predoctoral research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School in the [Health Inequality Lab](https://www.healthinequalitylab.org/). 

I am interested in topics in health, industrial organization, public finance, and innovation. I am grateful to have my graduate studies supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
